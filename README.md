## Erythemato Squamous Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of **erythemato-squamous diseases** is a real problem in 
dermatology. They all share the clinical features of erythema and scaling, with 
very little differences. The diseases in this group are **psoriasis**, 
**seboreic dermatitis**, **lichen planus**, **pityriasis rosea**, **cronic dermatitis**
, and **pityriasis rubra pilaris**. Usually a biopsy is necessary for the diagnosis but 
unfortunately these diseases share **many histopathological features** as well.
